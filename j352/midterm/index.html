        is timeless.<br><br>Until recently, it was
        impossible to mearue the popularity of older music. Billboard charts and album sales only tell us about a song's
        popularity at the time of its release.<br><br>But now we have Spotify, a buffet of all music, new and old.
        Tracks
        with fewer plays are fading into obscurity. And those with more plays are remaining in the cultural
        ether.<br><br>20
        years have passed since No Diggity's release. Its popularity on Spotify, relative to every other song from the
        90s, is a strong signal for whether it will be remembered by our children's children. So let's examine every
        song that ever charted, 1990 - 1999, and rank them by number of plays on Spotify, today.<br><br>
    </p>

    <img src="images/spotifychart.jpg" alt="spotifychart" class="img-fluid">

    <p><b><br>Out of the entire catalog of music from the 90s, these are the tracks on the trejectory to survive.</b>
        Some
        of my friends were deeply disturbed by what's been lost in time (e.g., Pearl Jam). And No Diggity isn't just
        anecdotally timeless, it's the fifth most-played song from the 90s.<br><br>Note the tracks that hardly charted
        on
        Billboard, in their day. Smells Like Teen Spirit, a track that never reached the Billboard Top 5 when it was
        released in 1992, is not the most-played song from the 90s.<br><br>Using Spotify plays, we can also see which
        rappers are still remembered from the early days of hip hop (e.g., Biggie vs. Tupac).<br><br></p>

    <img src="images/90s-hits.jpg" alt="90s-hits" class="img-fluid">

    <p><br>Biggie has three of the Top 10 hip-hop songs between 1986 and 1999. This is a strong signal that future
        generations will remember Biggie as the referent artist of 80s and 90s hip-hop. And there's No Diggity as the
        top -- perhaps it's that glorious Dr. Dre verse.<br><br>Hip hop heads will lament the omission of Rakim, Public
        Enemy, or Jay-Z's Reasonable Doubt. It's a depressing reality that exists for every genre and generation: not
        every artist will be remembered. The incoming generation will control what's relevant from the 90s and carried
        into the future, independant of quality and commercial success. For rock, that might be Blink-182. For
        electronica, that might be Sandstorm.<br><br></p>

    <h3>Present-day Popularity: <br>Five Decades of Music</h3>

    <p><b>Past popularity doesn't always translate into present-day popularity.</b> Here's how that manifests across all
        genres and decades.<br><br>For the entire 1980s, Don't Stop Believin' is the most-played song on Spotify. This
        song
        barely charted on Billboard. From the 70's: Bohemian Rhapsody. If we were to time travel to either decade, no
        one would reasonably believe that these two songs would be cultural touchstones for their respective decades in
        2015.<br><br><b>Over time, our biggest stars will fade, and sometimes surprising acts emerge.</b> Let's examine
        this
        pattern to better understand the present-day popularity of historic superstars.<br><br>Here are the top-5 tracks
        from the 90s, along with Billboard performance in the year of each song's release date.</p>

    <p>There were 41 more popular songs in 1991 than SMells Like Teen Spirit: End Of The Road (Boyz II Men), Baby Got
        Back (Sir Mix Alot), Save The Best For Last (Vanessa Williams), and I'm Too Sexy (Right Said Fred).<br><br>Since
        1992, these songs have slowly faded from culture with the incoming generation, whereas Nirvana's music has not
        only maintained its popularity, but augmented it.<br><br>For example, in 1961, Bobby Lewis's Tossin' and Turnin'
        spent 7 weeks at #1. For all intents and purposes, Bobby Lewis was the Beyonce of 1961. Yet, have you heard of
        it? Do you know who Bobby Lewis is?<br><br>Meanwhile, Etta James' debut album dropped the same year, with At
        Last
        peaking on Billboard at #68.<br>Music historians will regard Bobby Lewis as a pioneer in rock and roll and R&B,
        yet whatever led to Tossin' and Turnin's popularity in 1961 has faded over time. His music, for countless
        reasons, didn't persevere in the same way as Etta James'.<br><br>One hypothesis: Tossin' and Turnin's success
        had
        more to do that just the song...perhaps Bobby Lewis was a huge personality. Great looks. Amazing dancer. <b>When
            we examine pop hits, popularity is so much more than song quality</b><br><br>But future generations don't
        remember Bobby Lewis's dancing and good looks. Spotify only catalogues his music. And unfortunately, that
        quality didn't endure in the same way as At Last. (And of course, we have not even considered the role of
        covers, samples, and movie soundtracks, etc. -- a future project to undertake).<br><br>And for this reason, it
        will
        be weird to hear future generations reverently listen to groups such as Nickelback -- the kids only know their
        music, not what they culturally stood for in 2015.<br><br>Thus far we've only examined two sets of data points:
        popularity at release (Billboard) and popularity today (Spotify).<br><br>Yet, we don't know what happened
        in-between: a song's trajectory from peak popularity until today. If we had such data points, we'd be able to
        understand how major cultural events or changes in taste influenced the trajectory of a song.<br><br>With
        Spotify,
        we have so much more detail: daily playcounts. We can understand a track's decay rate from its peak popularity:
        whether it's quickly fading from culture or holding stady to be played by future generations.<br><br>If we were
        to
        review "Best of 2013" lists, Daft Punk's Get Lucky and Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines would be cultural
        touchstones. Get Lucky won the Grammy for Record of the Year and Blurred Lines was nominated.<br><br>If my
        children's children were to ask what we listened to in 2013, I'd pick either of Pharrell's collaborations or
        someone like Calvin Harris.<br><br>But that was two years ago, and we expect popularity to fade. Today, one
        track in
        particular has the most interesting trajectory: OneRepublic's Counting Stars. Counting Stars never had breakout
        success following its release, yet it has managed to stay in the cultural zeitgeist for more than a year after
        its peak popularity.<br><br>One hypothesis: Counting Stars had a chance to spread organically via word-of-mouth
        since its APril 2013 release, cascading from indie music circles to casual listeners. Get Lucky, on the other
        hand, dominated music channels in its heyday. Most people likely heard the track via mass media rather than
        friends.<br><br>When a track experiences such a rapid ascent, it's a deal with the devil: the song achieves
        commercial success, but it also saturated culture in such a way that there's immense listening fatigue among
        fans and fad-like connotations.<br><br>Lana Del Ray's Young and Beautiful and Arctic Monket's Do I Wanna Know
        look
        like modern equivalents of At Last: little commercial success on its release, but steady growth over time. Today
        in 2015, both tracks are at parity with Royals and Get Lucky, and you'd probably never guess it.<br><br>What's
        still
        popular from different periods in history is almost never the obvious choice. Accolades, Grammys, and cultural
        dominance mean nothing to future generations.<br><br>The artists who have cult-followings and underground
        appeal:
        it's a signal for some undefined musical quality that's impossible for a hit song to replicate. Perhaps it means
        that they are culturally ahead of their time. Or perhaps generations will feel obligated to share it, for fear
        of it fading.<br>Etiher way, time will tell.</p>
