    <h1>Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich</h1>
    <p>A <b>peanut butter and jelly sandwich</b> (PB and J) consists of peanut butter and fruit preserves—jelly—spread
        on bread. The sandwich may be open-faced, made of a single slice of bread folded over, or made using two slices
        of bread. The sandwich is popular in the United States, especially among children; a 2002 survey showed the
        average American will eat 1,500 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches before graduating from high school. There are
        many variations of the sandwich, starting with the basic peanut butter sandwich or jam sandwich.
    </p>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p>In basic preparation methods, a layer of peanut butter is spread on one slice of bread and a layer of fruit
        preserves is spread on another before the two sides are sandwiched together. (Jelly is a fruit-based spread,
        made primarily from fruit juice boiled with a gelling agent and allowed to set, while jam contains crushed fruit
        and fruit pulp, heated with water and sugar and cooled until it sets with the aid of natural or added pectin.)
    </p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Peanut butter was originally paired with a diverse set of savory foods, such as pimento, cheese, celery, Worcestershire sauce, watercress, saltines and toasted crackers. In a Good Housekeeping article published in May 1896, a recipe "urged homemakers to use a meat grinder to make peanut butter and spread the result on bread." The following month, the culinary magazine Table Talk published a "peanut butter sandwich" recipe.
        <br><br>
        The first known reference for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich appeared in the Boston Cooking School Magazine in 1901; it called for "three very thin layers of bread and two of filling, one of peanut paste, whatever brand you prefer, and currant or crabapple jelly for the other", and called it as "so far as I know original".In the early 1900s, this sandwich was adopted down the class structure as the price of peanut butter dropped. It became popular with children with the advent of sliced bread in the 1920s, which allowed them to make their own sandwiches easily. 
    </p>
    <h2>Variants</h2>
    <p>There are many variations on the sandwich; for example, honey or sliced fruit can be substituted for the jelly
        component, e.g., a peanut butter and banana sandwich.
        <br><br>
        Marshmallow fluff can also be substituted for the jelly, or added for extra flavor; this sandwich is called a
        "Fluffernutter".
        <br><br>
        The popularity of almond butter has inspired some to transition to "almond butter and jelly" sandwiches; other
        nut butters are less common. Seed butters, such as sunflower seed butter are also possible peanut butter
        substitutes. Cream cheese, substituted for the peanut butter, makes a "cream cheese and jelly" sandwich. Nutella
        is another possible spread.
