 <p><br>Hello! I am Joshua Banner, a reporter for The Diamondback as well as WMUCSports. I also work for ESPN as a technical assistent to sporting events. In reporting, I specialize in recruiting, focusing on the different aspects of how the 19 Maryland sports bring athletes in to commit. In addition, I do game reporting, previously focusing on Maryland football, volleyball, men's and women's basketball, and the 2022 NCAA Champion men's lacrosse team. 
    <br><br>My stories are written in a way that is easily diguestable, not overdone with clich√© and excessive vocabulary. I try to let the subject tell the story. Over my time as a journalist, I have embraced the flexability of my craft -- not only in what I cover, but how I cover it. This has lead me to report on a multitude of games, write a plethora of previews and summaries, profile players and record weekly roundups. I take up a challenge to make each story better than my last.
</p>
